## Practice Proj

As of my last update in January 2022, while I cannot provide real-time data on popularity, here are a few notable SwiftUI projects on GitHub that are considered large and comprehensive:

1. **SwiftUI-Catalogs**: SwiftUI-Catalogs is a project that showcases various user interface components and design patterns built with SwiftUI. It serves as a comprehensive catalog of SwiftUI examples.
   - Repository: [jogendra/SwiftUI-Catalogs](https://github.com/jogendra/SwiftUI-Catalogs)

2. **SwiftUICharts**: SwiftUICharts is a project that provides a collection of charts and graphs implemented using SwiftUI. It includes various chart types and customization options for displaying data.
   - Repository: [AppPear/SwiftUICharts](https://github.com/AppPear/SwiftUICharts)

3. **Tails**: Tails is an open-source app for tracking habits, routines, and goals. It's built entirely with SwiftUI and Core Data, and it demonstrates how to design and implement a complex application using SwiftUI.
   - Repository: [tailsapp/tails](https://github.com/tailsapp/tails)

4. **iDine**: iDine is a sample SwiftUI app created by Apple to demonstrate how to build a restaurant ordering app with SwiftUI. It covers various SwiftUI features, including navigation, data management, and user interface design.
   - Repository: [apple/tutorials](https://github.com/apple/tutorials/tree/main/iDine)

5. **SwiftUITodo**: SwiftUITodo is a simple to-do list app built with SwiftUI. It demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using SwiftUI views and Core Data for data persistence.
   - Repository: [niuniuzheng/SwiftUITodo](https://github.com/niuniuzheng/SwiftUITodo)
